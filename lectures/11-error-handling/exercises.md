# Exercises

## Exercise 1

Write a function that accepts a string, if the string is a single word, return the number 1. Otherwise, use synchronous error handling techniques to respond to strings that have more than one word. Demonstrate your error handling.

## Exercise 2

Update the previous exercise to instead use a callback to deliver an error.
