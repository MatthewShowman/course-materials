# MongoDB

- CAP Theorem
  - What is it?
    - Also known as Brewer's theorem
      - Computer Scientist Eric Brewer
    - States that a distributed system can only have 2 of the following 3:
      - Consistency: a database read will always return the most recent write to the database
      - Availability: every request receives a response, but is not guaranteed to contain the most recent write
      - Partition Tolerance: The system will continue to function even when network inconsistency drops data
    - Most RDBMs (i.e. SQL) prefer consistency over availability
    - Most NoSQL DBs (i.e. MongoDB) prefer availability over consistency
- NoSQL
  - What is it?
    - "Not only SQL"
    - "Non SQL"
    - A database that is not relational
    - Have existed since the 1960s, but didn't become popular until Google/Facebook/Amazon found them useful
  - What problems does it solve?
    - Easier horizontal scaling
      - Horizontal scaling is adding more "nodes" (servers)
      - Vertical scaling is adding more resources on a server (i.e. more CPU power)
    - Better availability
    - For the web, most NoSQL database structures mirror JSON
    - There are several different types of NoSQL database:
      - key-value
        - Very fast and simple data structure
      - wide column
        - Similar to relational databases like SQL, except each column in the row can store different types of data
      - graph
        - Relational data (like social relationships) where the structure of the data is best represented by a mathematical graph (i.e. nodes & edges)
      - document
        - Similar to key-value in implementation, but also include a query language to retrieve documents based on their content
  - What are some examples?
    - Redis (key-value)
    - MongoDB (document)
    - Neo4j (graph)
    - Cassandra (wide column)
  - Why MongoDB?
    - Easy to learn
    - Open-source
    - Lots of resources
    - JavaScript query syntax!
- MongoDB
  - Installation
  - Structure

      - Analogous to tables in SQL
    - Documents
      - Analogous to rows in SQL
  - Querying
    - Test Data Set
    - Mongo Shell
    - Create
    - Read
