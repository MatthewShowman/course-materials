- Command line
  - History
    - Shell: any program that users employ to type commands (-Wikipedia)
      - Interfaces directly with the OS kernal
        - Kernal is typically the lowest level component of an OS
    - First shell: Thompson shell
      - Written at Bell Labs in 1971
      - Lots of features for subsequent shells came from this one
    - First modern shells: Bourne shell & C shell
      - Bourne shell
        - 1979 at Bell Labs
        - Every current macOS & Linux distro comes with a version of this shell called `bash`
          - Bourne Again Shell
      - C shell
        - Bill Joy as grad student at UC-Berkeley in late 70s
    - Unix Shell
      - Serves as a command language and scripting language
      - `bash`
        - Written by Brian Fox in 1989 for the GNU project as free replacement for Bourne shell
        - Can enter commands or read them from a file (scripting)
        - Takes some features from C shell
